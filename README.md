# ABOUT MY ASSIGNMENT :cat: :dog:
The HTML structure is designed to provide a simple and clean layout for the Random Recipe Finder application. The main elements include:

- `<div class="container">`: This is the main container that holds all the content of the application. It is centered and has some padding for spacing.
- `<h1>Random Recipe Finder</h1>`: This is the title of the application, indicating its purpose.
- `<button id="getRecipeBtn">Get Random Recipe</button>`: This button is used to trigger the display of a random recipe when clicked.
- `<div id="recipeContainer" class="recipe-container">`: This container holds the recipe details, including the image, title, and instructions.
- `<img id="recipe-image" src="" alt="Recipe Image" />`: This is the placeholder for the recipe image.
- `<h2 id="recipe-title"></h2>`: This is the placeholder for the recipe title.
- `<p id="recipe-instruction"></p>`: This is the placeholder for the recipe instructions.

The CSS styles are applied to these elements to enhance the visual appeal and layout of the application.






## Run the project
- npm install
- npm run dev

## Standard Assignment
- Create main.js file inside src folder
- Based on the assignment brief, create a variable and put the variable value as below.
  
  `{
    title: "Spaghetti Carbonara",
    instructions:
      "1. Cook spaghetti according to package instructions. 2. In a separate pan, cook pancetta until crispy. 3. In a bowl, whisk eggs and grated cheese. 4. Combine spaghetti, pancetta, and egg mixture, stirring quickly. 5. Serve immediately with additional cheese and black pepper.",

  }`
- Create an on `click` listener for the button
- Create a function `onRandomRecipe` where it will set the HTML DOM for `recipe-title` `recipe-instruction` and `recipe-image`
- The function will also set `recipe-image` width to "200px" and set `#getRecipeBtn` to be disappeared after click.
- Bind the function `onRandomRecipe` to the `click` listener button

## Challenge for more score
- Make a proper variable name for more a readable code.
- Put things into a variable for a meaningful naming.
- Make a function to get the random recipe for more neat code.
